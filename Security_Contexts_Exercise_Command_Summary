Kubernetes Security
Security Contexts Exercise
Commands Summary

The command to run a pod from the repository specified in the lesson is:

$ kubectl create -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/security/security-context.yaml

NOTE: OPTIONAL: You may use wget to bring the file down to your present working directory by entering:

$ wget https://k8s.io/examples/pods/security/security-context.yaml

Then you could look at its contents using an editor or with the Linux cat command.

If you bring the file down using wget, then you can run the pod with:

$ kubectl create -f security-context.yaml

To see which pods are running on your system, enter:

$ kubectl get pods

Once the pod is running, you may execute a shell inside the container instance, by entering:

$ kubectl exec -it security-context-demo -- sh

Once inside the container, you may list the directory contents:

$ ls -l

To change directory to the data directory, input:

$ cd data

Once the data directory is your present working directory, you can create a file with:

$ echo "hello" > test.file

Then list the file with ls to see its owner and group settings:

$ ls -l

You may also run a process status command to see the processes running and note the user under which they are running.

$ ps aux

You may exit the container shell by entering:

$ exit
